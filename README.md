# NetSketch

This is the README for NetSketch, a Java application that allows multiple clients to chat and paint together on a server

## Getting Started

First Run the Server.java class on the server.
Then Run Login.java class for each client. Do not forget to specify the IP adress of the server in the addressIP attribute of Login.java. By default it works for clients connected on the localhost.
